Learnin' the github

Esquire95 here.  Once upon a time, before the internet, I obtained a computer science degree.  Then, in a rash decision, I decided to go to law school, and took a detour from computers.  Now, I am the managing partner of a small law firm and am completely frustrated with commercial software applications that cannot be customized to do what I want them to do.  I have decided I should see if I still have any development skills remaining after being corrupted by the law.
I have been focusing my reintroduction to computer programming on Python and its various libraries.
